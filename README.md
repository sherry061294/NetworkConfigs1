Setting up EIGRP on a model network

The Model Network has been created, exactly according to the diagram. 
Loopback interfaces are created to represent more networks.
In the representation on the diagram, they have numbers written above or below them representing the number of users in those networks.

EIGRP is used to connect the different routers. 
Individual notes are made inside each of the Router files, Just as a few pointers to follow while programming the routers.
